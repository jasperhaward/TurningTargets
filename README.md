# RMRPC - Turning Targets

Source code for the Reigate Miniature Rifle & Pistol club's gallery rifle turning target project.

Built using an Arduino Uno Rev3, DM556 stepper motor driver and FL110STH150-6504A stepper motor. The Arduino Uno interfaces with the stepper motor driver, providing the right PWM pulses to rotate the motor, whilst also serving and responding to the browser based UI.
